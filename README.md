# Landing Page - DESGNO

This is the first time I create website by my self with html, css and javaScript.
This project or This project or exercise project was originally designed for use with [astro.build](https://astro.build/), but as a beginner I feel don't understand and master astro.build, and even now I'm still a beginner in the field of JavaScript (2023, 31th October).

So I decided to make this landing page with firstly design the user interface in Figma.

and then try to create the website with basic code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and hope one day I can recreate this page full in astro.build or better JavaScript.

I create this website within 2 weeks, LOL, but I gain a lot of experience, and it is true when @Thomas Weibenfalk says "If you want to code, you have to type it, not copy paste, because it is the way you memorize the code'.
